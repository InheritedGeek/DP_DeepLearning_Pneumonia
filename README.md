# Benchmarking Differentially Private Networks for Medical Imagery
In this paper we measure the effectiveness of e-Differential Privacy (DP) when applied to medical imaging. 
We compare two robust differential privacy mechanisms: Local-DP and DP-SGD and benchmark their performance when analyzing medical imagery records. 
We analyze the trade-off between the model's accuracy and the level of privacy it guarantees, and also take a closer look to evaluate how useful these theoretical privacy guarantees actually prove to be in the real world medical setting.
